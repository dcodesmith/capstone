# Capstone Project

The goal of this project is to apply skills learnt in this programme to real-world projects.

This project explores algorithms for black-box optimizationâ€”learning how to tune parameters efficiently when the function itself is hidden. The goal is to build practical skills for hyperparameter tuning and real-world ML challenges.


Tech Stack: Python, Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
